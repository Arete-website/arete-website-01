            In December 2019, Abisola, Ifihan, Omar, and Maryann met virtually
            and came up with an idea to help children and students learn soft
            skills. Omar gave the name Arete, a Greek word for "Excellence" The
            founders talked to some mutual friends, and Arete kicked off. Along
            with the Arete team, they have impacted over a thousand children and
            students across Nigeria by organizing and planning free training,
            outreaches, and Bootcamps on soft skills.
