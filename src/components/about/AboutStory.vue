            In December 2019, Abisola, Ifihan, Chioma (Omar), and Maryann came
            up with an idea to help children and students learn soft skills.
            Omar gave the name aretḗ, a Greek word for "excellence." The
            founders talked to some mutual friends, and Arete kicked off.

          <br />
          <p>
            Together, the founders, well-wishers, and volunteers have impacted
            over a thousand children and students across Nigeria by hosting free
            training, outreaches, and boot camps on digital and soft skills.
