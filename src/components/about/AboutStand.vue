            “Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the
            heart.” Elizabeth Andrew
            <br /><br />
            At Arete, we understand and cherish all our volunteers. Joining our
            team will expose you to a community of like-minded individuals
            bonded by their love of technology.

            “We need technology in every classroom and in every student and
            teacher’s hand, because it is the pen and paper of our time, and it
            is the lens through which we experience much of our world.” David

            Arete strives to educate children and support young people in their
            technical careers. We have a dedicated team of mentors who regularly
            check up on our students.
